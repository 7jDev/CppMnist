# CppMnist
Doing BackProp from scratch(calculating derivatives and chain rule) and training it on the mnist dataset. 

I successfully created a neural network that trains on the mnist dataset, but I am a terrible C++ coder. 
Since I am a terrible coder it processes each image in around 0.8 seconds. Although, very fun project learned about parallel programing and how neural nets work in the background.
